# About
This Dockerfile will build an image running the WildFly application 
server with a data source named java:/PostgreDS. That expects a running
postgres instance on jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres. 

The image is based on the Fedora 40 image and isn't intended for use outside 
of integration tests. Use Docker compose to get connectivity on localhost.
